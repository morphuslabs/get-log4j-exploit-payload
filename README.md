# get-log4j-exploit-payload

The GetLog4jExploitPayload (beta) is a Java class whose purpose is to download java classes (payloads) referenced by Log4Shell JDNI addresses. 

Log4Shell is the name given to a vulnerability affecting Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228). The vulnerability is associated with the Log4j JNDI lookup feature, which on versions <= 2.14.1, by default creates objects of the class returned by the lookup operation.  

### Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/morphuslabs/get-log4j-exploit-payload
cd get-log4j-exploit-payload
javac GetLog4jExploitPayload.java
mkdir <output-dir>
java GetLog4jExploitPayload <ldap address> <output-dir>
```

Do not include the "jndi:" on the address parameter. Pass just the ldap or rmi address. 

### Example

```
mkdir payloads
java GetLog4jExploitPayload ldap://127.0.0.1:1389/a payloads
Referenced class: http://127.0.0.1:8888/MyExploit.class
Retrieving payload...done.
```
